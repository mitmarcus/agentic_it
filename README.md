## üìù Project Updates

30sep25: This repo will be built iteratively, as I am working in a black box. Bureaucracy is a very slow process in big companies, it seems. The data I need and the environments are, unfortunately, not available to me at this time. Expect heavy changes in the initial process of design.

03oct25: Let's say the foundation is laid now. I really believe agentic coding shouldn't be abstracted under big frameworks, thus cremedelacreme contains everything necessary that I could think of. 

08oct25: The agent lives!!! fully working implementation
